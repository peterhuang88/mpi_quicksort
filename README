To run this file, modify run_quicksort.sh

You can change the number of processors that this runs on by modifying the number after
-np <NUM_PROCESSORS>

please note that NUM_PROCESSORS MUST ALWAYS BE SOME FORM OF 2^n (a power of 2), otherwise it will hang!

to run on x number of elements, use the following command:

./run_quicksort.sh x

where x is the number of elements you want to use. please note that the program will exit immediately if no
number is provided

one final note: for some reason, the program runtime for 16 processors and 100M elements has been fluctuating between
5 seconds and 11 seconds. i don't know why. serial qsort has been pretty steady at ~50 seconds
